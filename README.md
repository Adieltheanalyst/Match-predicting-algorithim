## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data manipulation and machine learning
- **BeautifulSoup**: For web scraping
- **Pandas**: For data analysis
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization

## Data Collection
The dataset was gathered through web scraping techniques using BeautifulSoup and requests to extract match results and shooting statistics from [FBRef](https://fbref.com/). This ensured a comprehensive dataset covering various aspects of the matches.

## Data Preprocessing
The raw data was merged, cleaned, and transformed to handle missing values and categorical variables. New features were created, including rolling averages for critical match statistics, enhancing the predictive accuracy of the model.

## Feature Engineering
Developed various predictors such as:
- Venue codes
- Opponent codes
- Match hour
- Day of the week

These features were designed to improve the model's performance in predicting match outcomes.

## Machine Learning
The predictive model was implemented using a RandomForestClassifier, achieving a precision score of approximately 70% in predicting match outcomes. This demonstrates the efficacy of the model and its potential for further analysis.

## Results
The model serves as a foundation for deeper analysis and understanding of team performance dynamics, showcasing practical applications of data science in sports analytics.
